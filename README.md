# 7SegmentDisplay
C source file and header file to make interfacing with 7 Segment Common Cathode Display easier


I used a 7 Segment Common Cathod Display with a PIC18F45K20 and used the MPLAB X IDE v3.26 with XC8 v1.37 compiler. The purpose of these files are to provide an easier way to interface a PIC with a 7 segment display. The code is written assumming that the display is connected to port C. The wiring instructions are listed in both the header and c file.
